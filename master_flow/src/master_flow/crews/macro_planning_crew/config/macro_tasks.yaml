    Build a learning blueprint for:
    Topic: {topic}
    Experience: {experience}
    Goal: {goal}
    Constraints/Worries: {constraints}
    
    Previous QA Feedback (If any): {critic_feedback}
    
    Step 1: Use your search tools to find standard syllabi and modern roadmaps.
    Step 2: Filter the research heavily based on the user's experience and constraints.
    Step 3: Output a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) using the Blueprint structure. 
    Ensure foundational nodes have empty prerequisites.
  expected_output: >
    A well-structured Blueprint object.

    Checklist:
    1. Does it respect their experience level (no basic syntax for seniors)?
    2. Does it respect their constraints (e.g., shorter modules if time-poor)?
    3. Are all prerequisite 'node_ids' valid and actually exist in the blueprint?
    4. Are there any circular dependencies?
    
    If it passes, set is_approved to true. If it fails, set is_approved to false and write detailed feedback.
  expected_output: >
    A QAEvaluation object containing the approval status, feedback, and the blueprint.
