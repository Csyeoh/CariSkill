# AMLS Project Setup Walkthrough

The boilerplate for the **AI-Powered Autonomous Micro-Learning System (AMLS)** has been successfully set up. This guide covers how to run the full stack locally.

## Project Structure

The project has been organized into a monorepo setup:
- `apps/web` - Next.js 15 App Router application with Tailwind CSS and `lucide-react`
- `apps/api` - FastAPI backend application using Python 3.11+
- `docker-compose.yml` - Infrastructure to run the Qdrant vector database

## Running the Application Locally

Follow these steps to get your environment running.

### 1. Start Infrastructure (Qdrant Database)
First, make sure Docker Desktop is running, and then run the following in the project root:

```bash
cd D:\Project\CariSkill\amls-root
docker-compose up -d
```
This will start the official Qdrant image on port `6333`.

### 2. Run the Backend API (FastAPI)

Since we are using Python 3.11+, we need to initialize a fresh virtual environment and install the correct dependencies. The `requirements.txt` contains `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `qdrant-client`, `crewai`, and `sentence-transformers`.

```bash
# Navigate to the API folder
cd D:\Project\CariSkill\amls-root\apps\api

# Create the virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# Windows (PowerShell):
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# Windows (Command Prompt):
.\venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# Install the required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the FastAPI server
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
Your backend will be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). The interactive API documentation will be at [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs).

### 3. Run the Frontend (Next.js)

To run the Next.js application, navigate to the web directory and start the dev server:

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend app
cd D:\Project\CariSkill\amls-root\apps\web

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```
Your frontend will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

> [!SUCCESS]
> You are all set! You now have a complete Next.js / FastAPI / Qdrant stack running for your AMLS project.
